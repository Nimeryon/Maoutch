# Explanation

## About Us
We are both 3rd year bachelor student at Bordeaux Ynov Campus, in Game Programing and this game was our final project for the year.

## Origins of the project

We had a choice between 4 different projects, a 2D platformer, a 2D shooter, a local multiplayer Pong and a match game. We choose the later option because it felt like the one where we could actually have an alpha prototype at the end.

## Making the game

First in our design of the game, we considered a bunch of approaches to the game, does making a match increase a score ? Do we have seperate levels ? Do we have powerup tiles ?

We ended going with a more RPG style system, when you make a match, you inflict damage to an ennemy, certain match do more damage according to the element of the match, when a match causes other matches your combo increases and you do more damage. All of this changes the gameplay, we go from making amatches to reach a highscore or finishing the level in the shortest amount of matches, to strategically making matches to deal the most damage or even trying to get a very high combo.

We had a lot planned, but due to time constraints, not having artists on hand, and other projects taking our time, we cut a lot of content we wished we could have done, we wanted to add special effects when you matched 4 or more tiles of the same element, bosses with unique mechanics and other interesting (but time consuming) things.

## Conclusion

This ended up begin a lot of fun to work on, and we are happy to continue making games in the future.
